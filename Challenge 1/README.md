## Challenge 1: Creating the producer and consumer

### Objective

- This challenge will introduce you to the basics of message queueing with LavinMQ.
- You will create a producer that sends messages to LavinMQ and a consumer that receives messages from LavinMQ — think of this as the “hello world” of messaging.

### Instructions

- LavinMQ facilitates the transfer of messages between a *sending* application called the **producer** and a *receiving* application called the **consumer**.
- **Your task here** and the first step towards creating your notification system is to spin up a producer and a consumer.
- We have a [detailed tutorial](https://hackp.ac/ghwdata24-LavinMQ-challenge1) on publishing and consuming messages to and from LavinMQ.
- Once you have a working producer and consumer, as per the tutorial above, proceed to the next challenge.
